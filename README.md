## DevOps

DevOps, short for "Development and Operations," is a set of practices, principles, and tools that aim to improve collaboration and streamline the processes between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The main goals of DevOps are to enhance the speed, efficiency, and quality of software delivery, ensuring that new features and updates are deployed rapidly and reliably.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository.
- Automated build and testing processes validate changes, reducing integration issues.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Automates the deployment process, ensuring code changes are deployable at any time.
- Frequent, smaller updates are delivered to production, reducing risks and increasing feedback.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code and automation tools.
- Ensures consistency, repeatability, and scalability of infrastructure setup.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure for performance and issues.
- Centralized logging helps identify and troubleshoot problems quickly.

### Collaboration and Communication
- Breaking down silos between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
- Promotes a culture of shared responsibility, transparency, and continuous improvement.

### Automation
- Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce human error.
- Covers various stages, including code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.
### Tools
- **Jenkins**/**Concourse**/**GitHub Actions**/**CircleCI**/**Travis CI**/**Harness**:
  - The primary purpose of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) tools is to streamline and automate the software development process, ensuring that code changes are integrated, tested, and deployed quickly and reliably


## Development (IN PROGRESS)

### Tools
- **GitHub**/**GitLab**/**Bitbucket**:
  - A platform for version control and collaboration.
  - Enables code sharing, pull requests, and code reviews.

## Testing (IN PROGRESS)
