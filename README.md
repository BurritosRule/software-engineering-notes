## Agile Software Team Roles

### Product Owner (PO)
- Defines the product vision and backlog
- Prioritizes features according to business value
- Acts as the primary liaison between stakeholders and the team

### Scrum Master (SM)
- Facilitates agile processes and removes impediments
- Ensures the team adheres to agile principles and practices
- Serves as a coach and mediator for the team

### Development Team (Devs)
- Collaborates to design, code, test, and deliver features
- Self-organizes to manage its workload
- Maintains continuous communication and feedback loops

### Quality Assurance (QA)
- Ensures that the product meets quality standards
- Creates and executes test plans and test cases
- Identifies and reports defects for resolution

### UX/UI Designer
- Focuses on user experience and interface design
- Conducts user research and usability testing
- Creates wireframes, mockups, and prototypes

### Stakeholders
- Provides input and feedback to the product owner
- Represents the interests of the end-users
- Involved in review and approval stages

## Agile Software Software Development Lifecycle

### 1. Identify Features and Requirements
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: The product owner, stakeholders, and team members collaborate to identify features and requirements based on user needs and business goals.
- **Feature Prioritization**: The product owner prioritizes the features based on their value and impact.

### 2. Create Epics
- **Define Epics**: Large features or requirements are initially captured as "epics." Epics are broad and high-level, representing substantial pieces of functionality.
- **Break Down Epics**: Epics are broken down into smaller, more manageable components called "user stories."

### 3. Write User Stories
- **Story Format**: User stories are typically written in the format: "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."
  - Example: "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Each user story includes acceptance criteria that define the conditions under which the story is considered complete.
  - Example: "Given I am on the login page, when I click 'Forgot Password' and enter my email, then I should receive a password reset link."

### 4. Backlog Refinement
- **Grooming the Backlog**: The product owner and team members regularly review and refine the product backlog, which contains user stories, epics, and other tasks.
- **Prioritization**: Stories are prioritized based on their value and urgency.

### 5. Sprint Planning
- **Select Stories**: During sprint planning, the team selects a set of user stories from the backlog to work on during the upcoming sprint.
- **Estimate Effort**: The team estimates the effort required to complete each story, often using techniques like story points or t-shirt sizes.

### 6. Task Breakdown
- **Decompose Stories**: The selected user stories are further broken down into smaller tasks or sub-tasks.
- **Assign Tasks**: Team members take ownership of tasks based on their expertise and capacity.

### 7. Development and Testing
- **Work on Tasks**: Developers, testers, and other team members work collaboratively to complete the tasks.
- **Continuous Integration**: Code changes are integrated frequently, and automated tests are run to ensure quality.

### 8. Review and Demo
- **Review**: Completed user stories are reviewed during the sprint review meeting.
- **Demo**: The team demonstrates the functionality to stakeholders and collects feedback.

### 9. Retrospective
- **Reflect**: The team reflects on the sprint's performance, identifying what went well and areas for improvement.
- **Implement Improvements**: Actionable improvements are implemented in future sprints.

### 10. Deployment
- **Deploy to Production**: Once user stories are complete and approved, they are deployed to the production environment.
- **Monitor and Support**: The team monitors the deployed features and provides support as needed.

### Common Tools
- **JIRA**/**HP Quality Center**/**Trello**:
  - Used for project management and issue tracking.
  - Helps teams plan, track, and release software efficiently.

## DevOps

DevOps, short for "Development and Operations," is a set of practices, principles, and tools that aim to improve collaboration and streamline the processes between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The main goals of DevOps are to enhance the speed, efficiency, and quality of software delivery, ensuring that new features and updates are deployed rapidly and reliably.

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository.
- Automated build and testing processes validate changes, reducing integration issues.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Automates the deployment process, ensuring code changes are deployable at any time.
- Frequent, smaller updates are delivered to production, reducing risks and increasing feedback.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code and automation tools.
- Ensures consistency, repeatability, and scalability of infrastructure setup.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure for performance and issues.
- Centralized logging helps identify and troubleshoot problems quickly.

### Collaboration and Communication
- Breaking down silos between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
- Promotes a culture of shared responsibility, transparency, and continuous improvement.

### Automation
- Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce human error.
- Covers various stages, including code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.
### Common Tools
- **Jenkins**/**Concourse**/**GitHub Actions**/**CircleCI**/**Travis CI**/**Harness**:
  - The primary purpose of CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment) tools is to streamline and automate the software development process, ensuring that code changes are integrated, tested, and deployed quickly and reliably

## Development (IN PROGRESS)

### Common Tools
- **GitHub**/**GitLab**/**Bitbucket**:
  - A platform for version control and collaboration.
  - Enables code sharing, pull requests, and code reviews.

## Testing (IN PROGRESS)
